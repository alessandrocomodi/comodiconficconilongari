Class, methods assigned
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The block of code assigned is included in only one class and regards in
 particular three methods, which will be shown below.
\end_layout

Name of the class: WebdavServlet

\begin_layout Chapter
Functional role of assigned class, methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The class assigned, as says its own name, is a WebDAV servlet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension of the
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that allows clients to perform remote
 Web content authoring operations.
 This servlet provides some functionalities thanks to which a user can create,
 move and change documents on a server.
 The most important features of the WebDAV protocol include the maintenance
 of properties about an author or modification date, namespace management,
 collections, and overwrite protection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Role of assigned methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below will be presented a short explanation of the functional role of the
 assigned pieces of code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
doUnlock( HttpServletRequest req , HttpServletResponse resp ), starting
 at line 1420: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This method, as says its name, unlocks a resource that was previously locked
 with the use of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doLock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method, which is situated just before the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doUnlock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If the request is locked or if the resource is a readOnly, the doUnlock
 returns without doing any change.
 Otherwise it starts to remove all the resource locks and inheritable collection
 locks, sending, in the end, a Status Code which informs the success of
 the operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
isLocked( String path , String ifHeader ), starting at line 1538:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This method checks whether a resource in a certain path is currently 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

write locked
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and, if so, it returns true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
copyResource( HttpServletRequest req , HttpServletResponse resp ), starting
 at line 1596:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This method offers the possibility to copy a resource from a source to a
 destination.
 In case the copy fails the method returns 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

false
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 otherwise.

ding of the code.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on

 there is though a non private class, WebdavStatus, that is instead protected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_deeper

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Methods are grouped by functionality rather than by scope or accessibility:

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Check that variables and class members are of the correct type.
 Check that they have the right visibility: 
\emph default

All the variables are declared in the right scope.

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Check that constructors are called when a new object is desired: 
\emph default
- There is only one occurrence of the creation of an object in copyResource
