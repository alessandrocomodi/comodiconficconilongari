2.4 Sequence of Component/Function Integration

This section provides the order we intend to integrate each component and subsystem to compose the final system in accordance with the previous strategy defined.

2.4.1 Software Integration Sequence

According to the strategy the integration test plan starts with three groups of components, each one representing a set of functionalities, that could be integrated parallely. The first group is the web client side of the application, which consists in the WebClient and WebServer component, the WebClient subsystem; the second one represents the Data layer of the system and is the join of the DataAccessManager component and the DBMS, the Data subsystem. Lastly we spot that the RideManager and the QueueManager can be seen as a third group of component's functionalities, the Model subsystem. Than we detect a fourth group of components that represents the Communication subsystem which includes the WebClient subsystem, the MobileClient component and the CommunicationHandler component.

2.4.2 Subsystem Integration Sequence

Each one of the groups of component described before can be seen as a subsystem. Therefore the subsystem integration sequence begins with an integration of the Communication susbsystem and the Model one. After this kind of merge we can integrate the big subsystem found before with the subsystem that concerns the Data part of the application. In the end we integrate all with the last component the SecurityManager and we obtain a system completely integrated tested.
