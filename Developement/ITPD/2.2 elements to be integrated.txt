The system can be divided in 3 big subsystems: a communication subsystem, an application subsystem and a data subsystem. The communication one is composed by the WebClient along with the WebServer component, the Mobile Client and the Connection Handler. On the other hand the QueueManager,the RideManager and the Application Controller compose the application subsystem, while the DBMS and the DataAccessManager are part of the data subsystem. All the subsystems must be integrated with the SecurityManager component.
