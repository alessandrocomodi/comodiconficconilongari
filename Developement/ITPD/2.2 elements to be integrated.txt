The system can be divided in 3 big subsystem: a communication subsystem, an application subsystem and a data subsystem.
The communication one is composed by the WebClient with the WebServer component, the Mobile Client and the ConnectionHandler. 
On the other hand the QueueManager and the RideManager compund the application subsystem, while the DBMS and the DataAccessManager build the data subsystem.
The first one and the third one are integrated through the SecurityManager, and all the subsystems should be integrated with the Application Controller component.
